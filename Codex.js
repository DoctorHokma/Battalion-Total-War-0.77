	DocText:[
		"<span style='color:white'>Somertin White Guards</span>",
		"Originally called 'The Paladin Corps' and held to the utmost doctrinal standard, although that is being zig-zagged. The standards are lowered or raised based on whether Somertin needs more elite infantry or whether it needs better-quality elite infantry.",
		"As of this war, the balance tilts overwhelmingly towards quantity than quality, such that the minimum requirements consist only of 'The capability of wielding the armament, and the willingness to die for their nation at any given moment.', telling of the impressive capabilities of the White Guards of before. Of note! The White Guard divisions are made of White Guards themselves and of 'Pages' who carry 40Kg of ammunition each, in addition to a Pușka Rifle. The ratio of Guards-to-Pages depends on time period and on battle, men may be taken from regular units to serve as Pages if there is a need for it.",
		"In what regards armament, the White Guards use the 10-Kg PVKA machine guns, which do not have impressive rate of fire, but are capable of tearing through walls and rocks, as well as being extremely reliable. The sufficiency of ammunition is ensured by the Pages, although the Guards themselves carry ammunition themselves. As side-arms, they use the Rapaka Pistol. Some Pages or Guards use Anti-Tank rifles or the (rare) 'TUB' recoil-less anti-tank weapon.",
		"In what regards equipment we can gloss over the Pivot Anti-Recoil Implement, whose only purpose is to reduce recoil and to improve accuracy. The most obvious feature of the Guard is his heavy armor. Which is not a pure-metal armor but a doublet, two centimeters of galvanized titanium alloy on the outside, five centimeters of gambeson on the inside. The outer shell is about as tough as a light tank's chassis, capable of deflecting bullets and shrapnel, while the inner gambeson mitigates damage to the body from the impact-shock of bullets, or artillery that did not hit close enough.",
		"In what regards culture, the Guards are held to extremely high standards of religious faith, physical prowess and willingness to self-sacrifice. They are the epitome of what can be obtained from a soldier, sans usage of drugs or surgical modification.Their lay culture is extremely competitive and proud, they hold disdain for other units and especially for other nations. And their hierarchy is very much influenced by who can carry the most ammunition. Other than that, they have little to no personality other than the morals inoculated by the training. A desired result.Fortunately their behaviour among civilians is exemplary. Perhaps to serve Somertin political image goals or religious doctrine, the Guards are subject to strict codes of conduit inspired from medieval codes of chivalry. Guard units almost never rape, wantonly murder or assault, but they do loot as much as other units, and in Polasian urban areas they tend to cause quite a shitshow of scandal and bickering with the locals.",
		"In what regards usage doctrine, the Guards fulfill an unique niche unavailable to any other nation. They are neither as vulnerable to small arms gunfire as conventional infantry, nor as clumsy as conventional armored units. True infantry tanks, they can buy time for industrial mobilisation and production of real armored units, or can carry out counterattacks against enemy formations that were exhausted. The Guards are difficult to take out and difficult to hold out against, sans posessing heavy armored units.",
		"<br><br><span style='color:black'>Kargit SpecOps</span><br><br>",
		"Going back to around 50 years ago since airplanes were first used in warfare, there have been parachuting troops. Initially the dominance was held by the Somertin Paratroopers with the 'Pantelimon Parachute', but they were surpassed by the greater efficiency of the Kargit 'Golovko Parachute'. The main difference being that by using the Pantelimon, ~15-20% of paratroopers would incur injuries at landing, wheras the Golovko offered no such issues. Moreover, the Somertins had no place for paratroopers in their military doctrine, wheras the Kargits did. And thus, the Kargit Paratroopers are the last serious such force in the world.",
		"They are called SpecOps because their use is Special Operations behind enemy lines, such as infrastructure damaging, bridge holding and such.",
		"In what regards armament, the SpecOps have a weight limit and cannot take more than 10Kg of gear with them, this limits them to a (4.3Kg)Shapka submachinegun and a choice between ammunition, grenades and explosive charges.",	
		"In what regards equipment, the Golovko Parachute stands out. It is made of silk reinforced with plastic material. And with the silk being imported from the Red Dragon Empire, the Kargi make sure to stockpile enough of it before starting any war.",
		"In what regards culture, the SpecOps contrast the rest of the Kargit army. Wheras the bulk of the army is recruited from uneducated, brutish commoners, the SpecOps recieve (militarized)education and special training. Out of the knowledge they will be far behind enemy lines, they are being taught to refrain from angering the local population. They are also taught various notions of geology, survival and bothanics, to ensure their survival.The SpecOp himself is young and cocky but with a real Espirit de Corps, each battalion has their own 'Brotherly Code' and traditions which range from drunken parties, 'Fuck Competitions','Eating Contests' to week-long mountain hiking trips. Trivia: Wheras the average IQ of the Kargit soldier is 95, the average IQ of the SpecOp is 110",
		"In what regards usage doctrine, the SpecOps are the Stiletto of the Kargit operational doctrine. They are always the first stage of an invasion, going behind enemy lines and ruining their supply hubs, rail-networks and radar installations. Their sabotage gives the conventional army a better performance in the shock attack that follows.",	
		"<br><br><span style='color:grey'>Transkalite Snipers</span><br><br>",
		"Uniquely among the nations, the Transkalite Sniper is not a conventional elite unit with special training. It is composed of ethnic battalions raised in the harsh taiga. Their profficiency with the rifle can be solely attributed to them having to hunt for surival from an early age.",
		"In what regards armament, the Snipers do not have any specific weapon. They will use the rifles they were raised with, or what rifles are given to them. They have taken a liking to anti-tank rifles however and use any that is donated by the Somertins with great profficiency.",	
		"In what regards equipment the Snipers have little unique to themselves, only the thick furs and the grey papakha gently swaying to the side.",
		"In what regards culture they are not a monolith, but without doubt the most diverse elite unit of all. Owing to their ethnic groupation, each battalion has their own traditions, faith, dress code and customs. However in general the Snipers are thrifty, resourceful, practical and cool-headed. ",
		"In what regards usage doctrine, they are uniquely completely-defensive units. Their particular skillset works best in terrain they are familiar with, not to mention the abysmal logistical engine of the Transkalite Commonwealth. Until this war, the Snipers never ventured beyond the borders of Transkal.",
		"<br><br><span style='color:blue'>Polasian Marines</span><br><br>",
		"Perhaps the least individually-impressive elite unit, despite being advertised as a well-trained, fierce and brave corps the Polasian Marine is neither particularly brave nor fierce. Perhaps attributable to their doctrinal divergence. Wheras the other elites were designed for fighting peer opponents, the Marines were designed for coastal takeover of minor nations without a proper army or industry. The 'elite' designation serves a practical purpose, to ensure the best men apply to join them.",
		"In what regards armament, the Marines use shotguns, carbines and anti-tank rifles, with grenades and mortars for support, and are expected to have airpower and naval gunfire to their aid.",	
		"In what regards equipment, the Marines are issued engineering gear that can be used to quickly build pontoons or rafts over rivers.",
		"In what regards culture they are the only Polasian unit with Espirit de Corps, and the least cowardly of their nations's forces. With all being young and predominantly provincial, they are less inclined to the ultra-urbanized morals of the Syndicalists, as well as disdaining 'Political Correctness'. Despite common rumours, they do not eat crayons.They ARE, however the best unit at swimming. Rivalling sailors, Marines can swim the entire width of a large river and are expected to, if there is a need for it.",
		"In what regards doctrine of usage, there is a divergence between propaganda and fact. Propaganda goes that they will storm beaches and fight fiercely to take them over, fact has them storming beaches and waiting for fire support to turn the combat in their favour. Sans this firepower, the Marines lose heart and falter. Nevertheless they are the best units on the continent when it comes to storming defended beaches or quickly crossing rivers.",
		"<br><br><span style='color:lime'>Elamite Stormtroopers</span><br><br>",
		"'The best indication of the sorry state the Elamite Army is in, is that units are called Elite simply for being fully-equipped with equipment that is de-jure the mainstay of the army' - quote attributed to Paramount Marshal Khuzov. Indeed, the Stormtroopers are the only fully-equipped units of the Elamite Army, but that should not be reason to underestimate them. They have been assembled from battle-tried battalions(experience from the Akkadian Wars), equipped with good gear and each private shows courage and self-sacrifice that almost matches the White Guards.",	
		"In what regards armament, the Stormtroopers embody Elamite ingenuity. They have more mortars and grenade launchers per platoon than any other army. That must be put into context, Elamite light mortars have the best rate of fire in the world, and Elamite grenade launchers have the best range in the world. The privates that are not issued either GL or LM's will be issued assault rifles.",
		"In what regards equipment, the Stormtroopers are undergoing a transition from heat-resistant white robes to green uniforms(green pigment is the easiest to manufacture) which will perform better in the cool continental climate of Somertin. Aside from that they have no characteristic piece of gear save from the 'Elamite Sack', an implement that carries mortar ammunitions safely and easily.",
		"In what regards culture, we must mention Elamite units are formed around 'Pots'. Each Stormtrooper belongs to a 'Pot' with comrades he considers brothers(often the actual case) and with which must cook and eat together with. Pots are grouped into further formations such as platoons, companies, et cetera.They recieve brief Ishlamic education and are assigned one mini Qu'ran per 'Pot', which they will use to perform regular prayers and observe ritual fasting. They are expected to give their lives for the Sultan and for Shallah, however unlike the White Guards of Somertin, there is no doctrinal enforcement. White Guards will be sacrificed to hold ground and achieve objectives, wheras Stormtroopers can be engaged and disengaged with more levity. The primary reasoning is availability of armaments. Stormtroopers can not be wantonly thrown away, for that would mean the loss of armaments that are expensive and hard to replace.",	
		"In what regards doctrine of usage, the Stormtroopers are the culmination of min-maxing in the context of an insufficiently-industrialized nation and fittingly their model is being imitated world-wide by Maharlikan Juramentados, Chaco Republicans or such. The armament is designed to create a 'Death Zone' between 400 and 500 meters away from the Stormtroopers, and whomever tries to charge at them can be intercepted by a decent volume of gunfire. Perfecting an atypical squad system(Elam uses 5-man squads wheras the others use 9-12 man squads), they are also more versatile than normal units and can cover wider areas with fewer people. The most common method of engagement for Stormtroopers is launching devastating firepower from a distance, and withdrawing before enemies can counterattack them."]

		"<span style='color:white'>SHAAC Mark G 'Imperterritus'</span><br>",
		"When it was deemed that the 41-ton Gorlitz was useless, Somertin thought of up-armoring it massively in the hopes that it would advance unimpeded and provide cover for the infantry that was supposed to accompany it. (The Tercio doctrine still dominated at that time, where Somertin High Command believed that land units should be deployed in 3 ranks. One of infantry that would harass the enemy line, one of armor that would repel enemy pushes and one of artillery that would harangue enemy lines from afar.)",
		"Model A had 64 tons and could barely muster 14Km/h of top speed, so only 3 sample models were produced",
		"Model B had 67 tons as a stronger engine was developed and it was up-armored to contain the new engine. 25 models were produced before the Koschei became known and this one's cannon was deemed unsatisfactory",
		"Model C had 71 tons as a result of a naval-grade cannon being installed(an adaptation from the 127mm cannon used by destroyers) but when problems with the suspension became apparent, mass-production was canceled. ",
		"Model D improved the suspension, radios and storage. Mass-production was finally approved and 120 models were assembled in shipyards, as armor factories still did not have the right tooling for it",
		"Model E was a second up-armoring up to 95 tons, but left all factories except locomotive plants unable to build them.",
		"Model F perfectly balanced its armor, suspension and speed and the factories were now capable of mass-production. 250 were built",
		"Model G(at 105 tons) rebalanced the armor layout and redesigned the Imperterritus with modular layout and high-angle sloped armor in mind. It became the golden standard and more than 2000 were produced during the war. No further version was designed because SHC believed superheavy tanks had reached the peak of what they can realistically achieve",
		"Nowadays when one speaks of the Imperterritus it is assumed that they refer to Model G, as it represents over 85% of hulls built. It served as a mobile bunker, providing cover to infantry and arillery and delaying Kargit advance during the Deluge phase. Few to no kargit weapons could pierce it, and bombing it sounds better in theory than in practice.",
		"When the counterattack phase began however, it was briefly used as a brecheur tank to modest results. It being unable to be pierced was an asset, surely, but its inability to dish out firepower in return made it a sluggish boulder whose assaults culminated early and with little ground covered. It was fortunate then that Dumitrescu and Anders had a good deal of creativity. Using motorized artillery and infantry, they managed to amelliorate these faults",
		"With that being said, it performed admirably against bunkers and fortifications, breaching the Sheblah, Golchab and Thargirion Lines with ease",

		"<br><span style='color:black'>Pantser VI 'Koschei'</span><br>",
		"The 58.2 ton steel monster embodied Kargit military doctrine of breaching weakpoints, breaking the line and encircling isolated positions. It was the only heavy tank in the world to perfectly balance armor, gunnery and mobility while still being reasonably reliable and easy to produce(due to perfectly-adjusted tooling and lathes, Kargia could produce on average 25% more Koscheis than one would expect)",
		"It mounted a 90cm cannon capable of piercing any other tank(even an Imperterritus, if it was hit from behind, or from the sides within 200m) and with its Putin Engine, it could go as fast as 47-50Km/h top speed, but in combat conditions 15-20Kmh would be more reasonable(still way above any heavy or superheavy tank, and more in line with a medium tank's speed)",
		"Its real unique feature was that each and every tank was issued a radio(as opposed to two per battalion in Elam or one per platoon in Somertin and Polasie) with which they would coordinate attacks in real time and strike at more targets at once.",
		"After the war, despite it frequently losing 1-on-1 against the Imperterritus the Astartian Military Command believed it to be the most suitable armored vehicle for modern combat, and was taken as foundation for the Crusader series of modern tanks",

		"<br><span style='color:grey'>Jarnsvagkanonbatterie 'Big Bertha'</span><br>",
		"'A snot-nosed amateur loves the BB because big dakka go big boom. A dilettante admires the BB because it is useful in a variety of situations. A professional respects it because it's easy to disassemble and transport.' This homely anecdote is pretty descriptive of why Big Bertha was chosen by a Buttfucknowhere nation",
		"It's been specially designed to be easy to disassemble and reassemble for a nation where elk and mule transport is the norm. True, the transkalite army prefers it to be railroaded around but in much of Transkal that is an impossibility. So oftentimes it had to be disassembled, carted away by a herd of 1.000 mules then reassembled. The speed with which Transkalite units can do this is nothing short of impressive",
		"Regarding raw stats, it is a 93-ton steel beast that fires 40-cm heavy artillery shells. Such a weapon musters a mediocre amount of firepower due to its long reload time, although operating in Somertin tends to improve that, as ammunition and spare barrels(it has a tendency to shatter its barrel after 100 shots) are much easier to supply with Somertin's developed rail network.",
		"Doctrinally speaking, there is no established way to use it. Whether for deception, for raw firepower or to deter shore bombardment, it can perform all of these adequately enough.",
		"After the war, all existing Berthas were sent to various museums. And a few more were produced specifically to be displayed in museums",

		"<br><span style='color:blue'>Amphibious Armored Assault 'Crab' Tank</span><br>",
		"At merely 23 tons, this polasian dwarf is unattractive in matters of raw stats, falling somewhere between the Bolt and the Asekara in competence",
		"However, what it lacks in martial prowess it makes up in positional warfare. Uniquely among tanks, it is completely waterproof and capable of crossing a river as deep as 5 meters through an innovative and battle-tried snorkel system.",
		"Doctrinally, Polasie uses it both to take over beaches and to cross inland rivers. Although these days the main obstacle is that the other side of a river is almost guaranteed to have enemy armor. Armor that more often than not can overpower an unescorted Crab. Air superiority or artillery support is recommended to assist a Crab's river crossing attempts",

		"<br><span style='color:lime'>Antitank Multi Purpose Armored Charriot(AMPAC)</span><br>",
		"This 33.5 ton vehicle is the child of Elamite ingenuity... and desperation.",
		"Halfway between the Akkadian Wars and the Astartian Great War, Elam decided to no longer build both normal tanks and medium tank destroyers, and instead geared 80% of its limited industry for the mass-production of the AMPAC. It turned out to be a good choice, as Elam found itself constantly underarmored and fighting an enemy that had thousand of armored vehicles to spare. Were it not for AMPAC's versatility and efficiency against the hopelessly outmatched Asekara, they would have stood no chance",
		"Armed with a 80mm AP cannon, boasting a 70mm 60* angle armoured chassis and a top speed of 40Km/h(and 20Km/h in rugged terrain), AMPAC is an extremely versatile tank, able to move swiftly, to climb easily and to conceal efficiently. It also has a machinegun next to the main gun, for easier suppression of infantry",
		"Due to its design, Elamite army command has deduced that although good on paper, the fixed cannon design would cause it to only work adequately in offensive operations and would lose efficiency when defending. This was no problem for the first part of the war, but that changed when Elam lost the initiative. So as to not be completely overwhelemed, elamite command had to master a particular type of elastic defence. The AMPAC found itself the jewel of elamite warplanning. With the rugged terrain and numerous ambush opportunities Elam managed to hold on a little longer, striking at exposed columns and downhill slopes",
		"After the war, it was studied by the Astartian authorities and used as a basis for the TWV's of the future"

		"Heavy Bomber: Supposed to be a bigger version of the Condor, bigger, more expensive and with better stats. But then again the Kargits could use it as well so it would not be exclusive. Did not end up adding it, as it's merely an upsized Condor and back then we had to conform to a 40-unit roster. Only after the roster overhaul did we reconsider it.",

		"Attack Helicopter: It was supposed to be Kargit-exclusive and to break the gap between the raptor and the condor. Then we thought of the Eagle and the attack heli would have been nothing more than a shittier Eagle, more expensive and with lower stats. And anachronistic as well",

		"Transport Helicopter: Transkal-exclusive. Fulfills the same niche as the Supply Truck, but is more expensive and heals less in exchange for slightly higher mobility.",

		"ASW Helicopter: Supposed to be an expensive but fast unit specialized in hunting submarines, exclusive to Polasie. Rejected because hunting subs is not a big concern",

		"Suicide Bomber: Considered to be implemented for Elam. Rejected because it fails the practicality test. Suicide bombers are only viable when the nation has a surplus of aircraft, no land theater to use them on but is in severe naval inferiority. Elam had a land theater and a shortage of planes; plus the already diminutive South Transkal navy has expended itself. There was no threat from Somertin's navy as it would need to embrace risky parity with Polasie's navy AND sail all the way around the East Pole towards Jylla where berthing docks were inadequate. As such, suicide bombers were pointless",

Special_Ships={
		DocName:"Special Naval Units?",
		DocDesc:"An anthology about the idea of implementing special naval units and how it could not be done in the end.",
		LengthIndex:2,
		DocText:["Originally, there were hopes of following the pattern, as to how infantry and armor units have a few that are available to some nations and unavailable to others. Similarly I hoped there would be special ship units available to various nations.",
			"The issue however, was that besides me wanting to preserve a notion of units being grounded in WW2-era technology, most of the nations did not even have a naval tradition. We'll go over what units were planned for whom, and you will understand what I mean",

			"Aircraft Carrier: It wasn't supposed to be a common unit but much like the Imperterritus, the best and costliest unit only available to Somertin. In reality the era of the carrier is knocking and the great industrial powers already have theirs. That included Somertin, Polasie(which converted 4 battlecruisers into carriers as a response to Somertin building 5 carriers from the keel up) and Kargia(which converted one of its battleships into a carrier)",

			"Aviation Battleship: Not to be mistaken with real-life IJN's attempts to make a half-battleship half-carrier hybrid. Reality has proven that doing so results in a monster with a flight deck too short for most planes and with a hull too unbalanced to fire its riggings accurately. In this game it would denote a carrier that has been built by conversion from a battleship. Ironically though battleships are more resilient to conventional strikes than carriers, battleships converted into carriers are actually weaker, for their ammunition mains are more exposed and the electric grid is not fully compatible with what a carrier needs to do. It would have been the Kargit special ship. A cheaper carrier with lower speed and lower HP",

			"Aviation Battlecruiser: Similar to above, it denotes a battlecruiser converted into an aircraft carrier and was supposed to be Polasie-exclusive, given that Polasie is the only colonial power on the continent(but only in Chapter 2 will its colonial holding have any relevance) and thus needed battleships with a longer range of action, thus amassing a fleet of battlecruisers of which it already converted 4 into carriers",

			"Light Carrier: In real life light carriers can be built from the keel-up but in this game they refer specifically to Polasie's late-war conversion of 5(or 6?) light cruisers into smaller aircraft carriers. And it thus would have been a Polasian special unit. A carrier with half the cost, half the HP and half the DPS(since light cruisers have shorter decks and thus cannot accomodate heavy planes or torpedo bombers as a fleet carrier would)",

			" Sol-class/KETER-class Superbattleship: Polasie and Somertin have for decades engaged in a race of building the most stupidly big battleships. Following the launch of SFN Hokma(with 52.500 tons and 41cm guns, it is not considered a superbattleship), Polasie built the 65.000-ton PSS Sol with its 51cm batteries and Somertin answered with the 77.000 ton SFN KETER and its 53cm guns. These last 2, the Sol and the KETER, are far above most battleships in raw power and would serve as Polasie and Somertin-exclusive units, battleships with vastly higher HP and DPS. But the existence of carriers makes them useless and merely a money sink. They were still implemented, but not as a distinct unit. Only as a plot device and with allegations of having been part of Operation THAUMIEL, although that is questionable",

			"Fast Battleship: 10 years before the Great Astartian War, Sultan Faruk put Pasha Hassan in charge of Elam's backwards navy. Hassan's ambition and sacrifices(he had even invested his own salary into the retrofitting operations) saw the ECS Yavuz Selim and ECS Osman Evvel completely facelifted. Their design happened to be scalable so he outfitted them with new rigging, reinforced their armor and installed a new engine. Thus from the obsolete battlecruisers he obtained two modern battleships, and quite a bit faster than the standard battleship of the day. This sent a wave of joy throughout the Ishlamic world as for the first time in 300 years, Faruk's Elam had a relevant(albeit a little lacking in screeners) navy. As such, the Fast Battleship would be Elam-exclusive, with the same price as a battleship but faster by 1-2",

			"Supercruiser: General Vilho's ambition to modernize Jarvi is not addressed, but he has done real efforts. Even going as far as to import two heavy cruiser hulls from Polasie and guns and FCS from Somertin in order to assemble the HMWS Vainamoinen and HMWS Ilmarinen. These two were the size of a heavy cruiser, but with the gunnery of a battleship, and capable of beating any cruiser 1-on-1. Much to Vilho's dismay, the carrier made his creation useless. But for the sake of the game, Transkal would have been able to build cruisers with a slightly higher price but bigger DPS and range",

			"Littoral Cruiser: Two decades ago Polasie has undergone a doctrine shift. Believing that heavy cruisers will no longer play a great role in naval warfare because of battleships and battlecruisers, they had instead converted them towards fulfilling a different role. Polasie's heavy cruisers use light cruiser rigging but much more of it. More guns of lower caliber capable of being used on the coasts to support a naval landing. It turned out that they were right and they had the best cruisers for coastal support. Littoral Cruisers would have been Polasie-exclusive and would trade base DPS for a trait that causes them to deal double damage to land units",

			"Baklava-class Heavy Destroyer: Elam-exclusive, a slightly more expensive destroyer with higher stats",

			"Pilgrim-class Corvette: A cheaper, weaker destroyer exclusive to Somertin and specialized in hunting submarines/aircraft",

			"Submarines","There might be confusion, but I will explain. The game does not have submarines implemented, only Submersibles which are only capable of diving underwater for a limited time. Submarines would be Kargit-exclusive and being capable of diving indefinitely, would have been a high-cost submarine but with higher HP",

			"<br><br>As you see Kargia, Transkal and Elam had one special ship each that were merely variants of standard ships, while Somertin and Polasie had 3 special units each. There's like 20 ideas for ship types, but only 10 slots where they'd actually fit so... yeah. Lot of them had to be truncated."]

	DocDesc:"Edited by Petru Pitei, it explains the basic premises of this world's geographic pecularities and goes into detail about the Astartian continent's geography",
	LengthIndex:4,
	DocText:[			"General geography",

"This world exists not on a north-south polar axis(like yours does) but west-east. This proximity to the Oriental Pole explains that the more you go east in Transkal, the colder it is(Jylla/Svelge being borderline livable, Norgel/Jarvi being frigid and hostile and Kolguyev Territory being utterly brutal, inhospitable even). Air currents also imprint a warm/dry effect on Astartia's southern coast, hence why Elam, Vedra and Sabrak are more of the arid/semidesert kind",

"And though the continent of Astartia is the most relevant(the whole plot taking place there), there is more. No matter who you ask, there are eight continents, but which exactly is a continent and what their name is depends on whom you ask. The Albion historiography is the commonly accepted one(due to their global influence) where Asia, Aeuropa, Affricia, North and South Columbia, Orientalis, Io and Polaris are the 8 continents, wheras the Somertin historiography lists the following as continents: Ațilut, Iețira, Beria, Asiya, Columbia, Astartia, Austronesia and Terra Glaciae",

"The correspondences are as follows:",

"Asiya<->Asia, Beria<->Aeuropa, Iețira<->South Columbia, Ațilut<->Affricia, Columbia<->North Columbia,Astartia<->Io, Austronesia<->Orientalis(Note: Austronesia is vastly larger than Orientalis, including Maharlika and the Tropical posessions of Polasie instead of ascribing them to Asiya/Asia), Terra Glaciae<->Polaris(Note: Transkal does not use either name, it instead calls them various names such as Kolguyev's Nowhereland, Transkolguyeva, the Perdition, Hypernatolia, etc)",

"Somertin's historiography is only used because this is the story of Astartia and 4 out of 5 astartian nations use the somertin system(all except Polasie). Naturally since the story takes place here and nowhere else, we will only study Astartia in this publication",			
"Physical geography of Astartia",

	"General:",

"Spanning 21.05Km2 and home to 534 million people living in 6 recognized states, it is the 4th largest continental mass and second by population. It has the third fewest nations of all continents(with Polaris having none and Austronesia having only five if going by somertin notation, otherwise two by albion notation)",

"The six recognized polities are, in order of population: The Synarchy of Somertin, the Kargit Revolutionary Gosudarstvo, the Sublime Caliphate of Elam, the Commonwealth of Transkal, the Republic of Polasie and the Kingdom of Gyros. The latter is often forgotten due to its noninvolvement in the war, however.",

"There are a number of unrecognized polities, temporary states or figments of a drug-addled imagination such as the famous Penisland Phallocracy and Republic of Cobrastan, but those have had no relevance on the plot",

	"Tectonics",

"Much like any large continent, it was formed by the collision of multiple tectonic plates. The Somertinic Plate is the center and gives contour to the first nation mentioned. To its west Kargia is formed of three distinct plates(the Paelazgian, Vedric and Sabrakian plates) and shares the Polasian Plate with Polasie(having control over the Etrurian Peninsula)",
"Transkal sits on top of the Transkalian Plate and the Kolguyev Microplate. Finally, Elam sits on the Elamite Plate.",

"The limits of each plate are obvious",

"The Somertinic and Transkalian have only merged 50-100M years ago and have the gigantic Kal mountain range between them, where peaks regularly surpass 5000m and the tallest one(Uriah) touches 7901m",

"The Somertinic and Polasian plates meet at the Dildo Ridge(called Popov Ridge in Somertin) which is the conventional 'border' between Somertin and Polasie and which Kielbasa Sound rises from. ",

"The Somertinic and Elamite plates meet in the Kandahar Mountains and in Shqiperia(Shqiperia is -due to the gradual rotation of the Elamite Plate- a VERY recent formation, estimated only 10-20M years old and expected to become a gigantic mountain plateau in the future). ",

"The Transkalian Plate and Kolguyev Microplate meet in the Norgellian Mountains and go all the way to Burba Ridge and on into the Kolguyev Strait where it joins the Polaric/Glacic Plate",

"Finally, the Somertinic and Paelazgian Plates meet at the Petric Mountains(also called the Rocky Mountains and Skalistykhgor). The Paelazgian Plate being the primary kargit tectonic formation shall be taken as reference; it joins Vedra at the Vedric Mountain Range(Vedrogorsky), joins Sabrak at the Sabrakian Massive and meets the Polasian Plate in the Rhaetic Mountains",

"There is also the Pula Microplate, on which Penisland and Cobrastan sat on",

	"Topsoil",

"It is widely known that much of Kargia's soil is arid, dry and eroded, that after all was one of the main reasons the Great Astartian War even started. ",

"In contrast, over half of Somertin is prime quality chernozym, a black and very fertile kind of soil. That chernozym is encountered in two main formations, the 'Anin Great Plains' and the 'Burlukian Great Steppe'. These two areas are in top 5 most fertile agricultural expanses and experts estimate the Anin and Burlukian plains could together feed two billion people, if not more.",

"Elam and Transkal(except for limited areas) have dry/desertic and rocky/frigid soils respectively, not good for agriculture.",

"Polasian soil is rocky and poor(except for the fritzian region) but with the population being minuscule there is no issue of feeding them",

	"Flora",

"Every continent has unique flora, this one is no different. The Transkalian Larch, for example, is world-reknowned",

	"Fauna",

"Every continent has unique fauna, this one is no different. The Burlukian Bee, for example, is world-reknowned for being the only blue species of bees.","Human geography of Astartia",


	"Broad History",

"Much like geographical historiography, there are two schools of thought. The Berian school of thought(popular in Berian colonial powers) puts history on a technological scale, from the primitive communes to the steel battleships of today. Alternately the Astartian school of thought puts history on a politological scale, from the bands and tribes of yore, to the knyas era, state era, superstate era, continentstate era and so on. Following Astartia's history from both politological theories would be time-consuming for a book not dedicated to astartian history",


	"Internal Politics",
"|There are excessively many ways to classify a nation and what people constitute it, in here we will first try to address what institution constitutes the power structure and if needed, and afferent ideologies that influence it at the moment|",

"Kargia is defined by its almighty state ('Gosudarstvo') presence. The state manages 100% of the economy and administration, all is from the state and for the state. However it is not, in fact, a stratocratic state not only because the dictator is technically a civilian, but also as the party leaders hold more sway than the generals, and the army has been merged with the paramilitaries in such manner that political loyalty of the army is complete and the loyalty of the generals is kept unquestionable with some...unsavory methods.",

"Transkal is de jure a matriarchal theocratic monarchy, de facto an oligarchy of autonomous warlords and generals. The power has theoretically been placed the hands of the Queen Goddess by millenium-long religious tradition(Transkal's traditional religions worship a Mother Goddess) combined with peculiar political conditions and circumstances, in practice she has no method of actively enforcing said power and is a figurehead. Sporadic efforts of centralizing the state have all failed, no dynasty managed to keep more than two competent, hands-on queens on the throne and power inevitably came back to the warlords, a typical situation for matriarchies.",
"The current Queen is said to pursue the dismantlement of the current status quo, but it is unknown how that will happen or what will come after.",

"Polasie is a liberal democracy, with maximum rights and minimum restrictions bound strictly to humanist principles. A certain thing is allowed if it doesn't hurt someone else. As a result it struggles with abysmal population decline, instability, unmotivated and understaffed military, political factionalism as well as a powerless central government incapable of tackling these issues(despite the Tax Break Party claiming the government to be 'too big'). The strongest institution there is the popular vote and the citizen, where every individual is a citizen",

"Elam is an islamic caliphate where the Sultan Caliph is the highest, most powerful institution. In theory, at least. Much like Transkal, the current Sultan is not almighty but unlike it, he is more readily obeyed, especially with Pasha Esfahani's extensive support.",

"And Somertin was left for last since it has BY FAR the most complex system. The Synarchist System(that is, the orthodox version) is defined by its hostility to the notion of a dominant institution. That either people, oligocrats, ideological elite or a single ruler should run the entirety of the state's affairs. As a result it has a complex array of institutions such as the Forum where nine institutions(Men, Women, Clergy, Academia, Craftsmen, Merchants, Army, Navy, Guards-later Air Force) grouped in three classes(laboratores-working class, oratores-intellectual class and bellatores-military class), the Triumvirate(Primarch, Paradygmist and Memeplexus), the Autocephalic Organs(of which the 'Kidney' is the most well known), the Hall of Paragons and the Conclave of Quaesitors. Any more delving into this system's excessively complex nature and how it nevertheless manages to keep the institutions working smoothly without butting heads in this book would be tedious. Enough to say Ladislav Chromit is the Primarch but not the sole ruler. He has been given a Mandate of Wartimes by the previous Paradygmist and maintained by the actual",


	"Demography",

"Of the 512M people, 235M live in Somertin, 137M in Kargia, 58M in Elam, 39M in Transkal, 38M in Polasie and 5M in Gyros. That is the pre-war situation, the Great War saw over 20M dead so we will not take postwar numbers into account",

"Phenotypically, the continent has an unexpectedly diverse racial/genetic status. Due to political motivations and interests, analysts diverge on what the 'races' are exactly. The existence of Homo extraneus, subsp. magnus is central; as it populates the majority of Somertin, Kargia and Elam, thus more than 80% of the continent's population has Magnus genes. Worth mentioning is that Kargia considers their own to not be part of the Magnus subspecies but of the Paelazgianus subsubspecies. Somertin geneticists dispute the notion that there would be meaningful racial difference between the two peoples. Transkal, on the other hand, has traces of Magnus genes, but the majority are very distinct, belonging to the Veilum subspecies. And Polasie is becoming more racially mixed but the native population belongs to the Parvus subspecies. All these subspecies are capable of interbreeding between themselves or with other Homo sapiens subspecies<br>Homo extraneus subsp Magnus is remarkable for the great size of its male individuals(1.80m average height and a thickset frame) and extreme sexual dysmorphism, heightened strength but early onset of chronic cardiovascular problems and thus a life expectancy 5-10 years lower than average. In comparision to real life examples it has been described to aesthetically resemble east-europeans; both the males and the females.<br>Homo extraneus subsp Veilum is an average 15-20 shorter than the previous; but no less well built. It also has adaptations to the cold environment he is living in; epicanthic folds for the eyes and balanced fat distribution. The Kal Mountains have caused such a radical difference and separation between it and Magnus<br>Homo extraneus subsp. Parvus is an average 1.65-1.70m in height and of a radically smaller frame compared to Magnus or Veilum; in theory due to having evolved on islands causing them to favour small builds that save energy. Sexual dysmorphism used to be significant in Parvus specimens, but cultural transformations have encouraged the feminisation of males and the masculinisation of females; as a result dysmorphism is artificially diminished to a significant degree.<br>Homo extraneus subsp. Paelazgianus is said by kargit literature to have superior intellect compared to all other races, but evidence is severely lacking.",

"Religiously, 137M are forcefully ascribed by the gosudarstvo to marcksist atheism(with estimates of 30-50M nevertheless having secret ritual practices based on old kargit faiths or covert christian influences), 3M more are atheist in Polasie, 20M irreligious/not practicing, 2M are 'spiritual but not religious', 6M are Baptist, 5M Presbyterian, Methodist or Quaker, 2M are ishlamis brought from the polasian colonies, 151M Catholic(rumoured to be closer to 170M in reality), 60M Astartian Orthodox(rumoured to be 50-55M in reality; ~40M of which are Ecumenic and ~20M non-Ecumenic), 11M minor forms of Christianity in Somertin, 13M Mosaic, 39M(rumoured to be much fewer after apostolic missions) ascribed to hundreds of native transkalite faiths, 42M Sunn Ishlamis, 15M Shahi Ishlamis and 2M Shqiperian Ishlamis in Elam and Shqiperia",

	"Industry",

"The Somertin and Kargit states are veritable industrial monsters, both of which are among top three global industrial powerhouses; Somertin (barely) on the first place and Kargia on third place. ",

"Due to its immense versatility and importance to many industries, it is common practice to measure industrial performance in steel production and we will stay integral to this method.",

"The numbers are as such: ",

"Somertin(pre-war) produced an annual 70 million tons of steel, at peak that rose to 140 millions but for most of the war it ran between 110 and 130 millions. They have produced a vast array of infantry equipment, artillery, vehicles, tanks and airplanes, as well as a navy to compete with the colonial powers(the fourth largest navy in the world at that point) including the largest battleship in the entire world. During the war, their industry churned out gargantuan numbers of infantry equipment, medium tanks and artillery, meaningful numbers of heavy and superheavy tanks, of guard gear and even built four aircraft carriers from the keel up.",

"Pre-war Kargia produced 60 millions, at the peak reached 100 millions and gradually went downhill until Bolwerkstaat Sabrak only managed 3-5% of these numbers. They have produced a vast arsenal of infantry equipment, artillery, vehicles, tanks and airplanes with which they started the war at a lightning pace. Their naval industry was noticeably less competent, disproportionately weaker than their army and air forces",

"Transkal produced 1 million tons per year before the war and grew to 3 due to the queen's reforms and the machinery they purchased from Somertin. Wheras pre-war they couldn't even produce enough rifles, after the war they had an air force and their own armored division",

"Polasie on paper produced twenty million tons per year, but de facto most of those were outsourced to Somertin, Kargit and Eagleland comntractors. During the war, they found themselves unable to produce more than 10 million tons, and the civilian sector demanding 90% of them due to them not being able to mobilize the economy at all. The last 10% were mostly used to replenish small arms/artillery lost, and armor/aircraft was on a steady decline until the end of the war.",

"Finally, Elam produced three million tons per year and a peak 5 millions during the war. With the width of their frontline, these numbers were insufficient to outfit their frontline divisions with enough rifles or artillery, and all armor plants were later repurposed to produce the cheap AMPAC",

"Gyros, fearing invasion from Elam, prepared itself with enough rifles, artillery and field guns for a defensive war, and with a wing of Akontio torpedo bombers(which they invented) to deter the elamite navy",

	"Economy",

"Due to the various oddball economic systems on the astartian continent, there is no accurate way to measure their performance, subsequently we will try as much as possible to paraphrase and explain the context",

"Somertin's economy though somewhat market-compatible cannot be accurately measured due to backing their currency to silver instead of gold, and there existing vast differences in ratio between the two metals between different markets these days. As well, they refuse to trade in the global exchange currency(Albion Pounds), artificially inflate the value of their own currency and apply ludicrous tariffs to all foreign agents that make it unlucrative to export to Somertin. A rough estimate puts their real GDP at 500-1000 billion AP(roughly 2nd or 3rd largest in the world). Their economy is rather advanced for a nation of such a considerable size and population, most economical sectors being present and developed but subject to awkward regulations. Several types of luxury goods are subject to strict limitations or bans, but not anything that one can't be happy without. The nominal GDP is 200 billion AP as declared by Ladislav Chromit and 2-4 times lower the real GDP, allegedly due to the great amount of non-financial entities operating but also with suspicions of Somertin presenting its GDP as lower than it actually is(for unknown reasons)",

"Nominally they follow the 'Farrkian State Distributism System', a tight and complex mix of orthodox distributism, free-market capitalism and state dirigisme, a functional outgrowth of the failed distributist economy system of before. Additionally, it is the only major global economy without a national stock exchange(Kargia interestingly enough has the Labour Board). The David City Stock Market is only a Vythm'k institution and does not include ventures outside that administrative district",

"Kargia's economy is even worse, impossible to quantify. Free trade does not exist except in limited black markets and smuggling, the state controls what gets produced and who gets what of it. Other than that it is pretty well developed, the citizens having access to most amenities and goods(albeit after having to wait in considerable queues). Heavy industry is predominant, mostly for the great war planned ahead.",

"Londinium Stock Exchange was quoted in claiming Kargia to have an economy VERY VERY VERY roughly equivalent to that of a nation in the 200-500 billion AP bracket, but mentioned these numbers 'might as well have been pulled out of their asses'",

"Transkal's economy is utterly feudal, with a quasi-pyramidal power structure where the upper echelons have access to luxury goods and opulence, while the lower echelons labour rocky soil and have little bar subsistence, worse still an estimate two to five million people live completely outside census, unknown to the government. A market system exists but is rudimentary. Nevertheless the Londinium Stock Exchange estimates Transkal total GDP to be of a measly 40 billion AP",

"Polasie is a free-market social democracy with high government oversight over the corporations and a vast array of social services including (in a certain region) universal basic income. In theory everyone is happy and has everything they desire, in practice high inflation is a matter of fact(though comfortably blamed on corporations so that popular discontent be kept to a minimum), prices outpace wage growth and due to large wages and environmental overregulation, large sections of production were offshored to foreign powers, some of which simply became hostile/belligerent and cut deliveries, doubling the cost of everything, later hordes of cheap colonial workers were brought in and paradoxically protected by the Welfare Party under the guise of 'humane' free immigration policies. ",
"The only nation on the continent(and among the few in the world) where the real GDP is lower than the nominal one. The Londinium Stock Exchange places Polasie's real GDP at 127.44 billion AP, with a foreign debt of 138.59 billion AP. It is by far the worst-performing economy on the continent and its bankers are quivering in fear of what may come, especially as the population constantly demands more and more welfare benefits to cope with the quickly rising prices.",

"Elam's economy is reeling out of feudalism much like Transkal's, but appears to follow Kargia's economic model rather than Somertin or Polasie's. The nation has vast numbers of people living in nomadic, seminomadic or feudal poverty but the urban core shows progress in industrialisation. Elam's industrialisation struggle has been bore by crown corporations where the state is the customer and production coordinator, and civilian goods production as well as common transactions are rather low. The Londinium Stock Exchange believes Elam's real GDP to be approximately 80 billion AP"]};

"Vasily Vasilyev Slobodov was almost a normal kargit man. Almost.",
"He was born a serf in the times of the Empire, cheered for its collapse and supported the Socialists when they promised land reform. This they delivered...for a month. Almost immediately after giving the peasants land, they demanded it be handed to the state and reorganized in collectives. Those who acquiesced became slaves to a new master, those who refused died. Vasily however, thought himself clever. He told them that he agrees to this collectivisation, but never signed and always delayed any such request with excuses, lies and half-truths.",
"At first they understood, they let him be. Later they were losing their patience and Vasily ran from home when the comissars(first Besarion's, then the Great Lord's) came, when he failed to hide he took beating after beating. Yet he refused, for ten or maybe twenty years, to give them his land.",
"Around forty, his wife died of pneumonia and his luck vanished little after. The comissars came and told him something like 'We are taking your children to the forest to pick mushrooms with us. I hope nothing happens to them'. He, finally, relented. Dragged off to Tambov he signed his land away to be given so they'd leave his children in peace; a year later they took those as well; the son for the army and the daughter for the factories",
"He lived through the war, the somertins did not harm him but stole and killed the cattle he was assigned by the state to care for. What came after shall always baffle me",
"When(after the war, during Hryniuk's governorship) told by a white guard that the somertin-astartian governance is decollectivizing and all will get a parcel of land alloted to be used free-willingly, he could not believe it. In no more than three days he made his luggage and ran to Tambov to inquire. He left overjoyed with a depeche to consult with the local guards which lands he can take for himself, and they gave him the land that would normally have been his",
"And when back on that parcel the man lost his mind. Villagers heard him laughing like a maniac, screaming furiously at the clouds and crying loudly, bitterly, in a manner that would unnerve anyone. All at the same time",
"Now 54, he was avoided by everyone. He had the nasty habits of talking to himself and kicking random fences for no reason; he spoke little and did not answer questions, fortunately he was not aggressive or troublesome; he was the benign kind of a crazy person. One day he just disappeared. Rumour has it he is searching for his children to this day, trying to piece together what life he had",
"Such a crazy man would have long been forgotten by history, were it not for providence. The same guard who told him of the collectivisation had dreams of being an actor, and he managed to get into Golubuju. He and others made a film about this man who lived through three different eras, bravely opposed the kargit boot for his entire life and then lost his mind with emotion",

"Aim for the clouds",

"In the heat of the Transkalite Civil War, Gustav's svelgian army was ordered to advance down the newly modernized Mura Railroad into Jylla. There they met the demoralized men of Krystof's banner and the battle with them was assumed to be brief and simple, due to Svelge having the superiority in armor, artillery and aircraft",
"But a week passed, two, and the line barely moved. Incredulous, general Gustav drove to the frontline to inspect the situation",
"There, he found his troops and Krystof's not fighting but biding their time. When in trench they would climb out and play with the enemy; when charging out of the trench more often than not they were aiming at the clouds and going back. The artillery was firing anywhere else, the tanks were not being driven and the planes were not strafing.",
"He realized that their fighting spirit was at a low, and disciplinary measures could only accomplish so much. So he sent an envoy",

"Patient 1000",

"Patient 1000 is a woman approximately 16 years of age from Stulpika. She was found by 19th 'Pervaya Tambovskaya' division's medical battalion lying uncounscious in a field and given summary examination.",
"Patient unresponsive, background and comorbidities indeterminable. Shows numerous open lesions on the forearms, arms, thighs, shins and abdomen, open right femural fracture (translative type), gunshot wound to the abdomen with purulent infection and seminal fluid in various places. Vital signs present, BP and respiatory rate diminished(100/70 and 10/minute).",
"|Diagnosis: Decompensated acute anemia caused by post-traumatic blood loss. Treatment unnecessary, euthanasia recommended.|",





"No",

"As Nierenstein was being pounded by wave after wave of artillery, Kargit High Command realized that the collapse of its defenses was imminent and only a swift counterattack was the only chance to gain any more time from that desperate situation. They sent order for the men to brace themselves for a 'bold offensive'.",
"|Anton Pavlov put the pistol inside his own mouth and fired|",



"The Dogtor",

"This happened during Operation Harpoon, when Somertin was pushing the Kargits out of Blachia. Argeseanu ordered an assault over a certain sector, and seventy thousand men charged the enemy trenches. Because of poor coordination they were repelled by machinegun and artillery fire, fifteen thousand of them could not retreat, but because of overwhelming air support neither could the kargits countercharge to ensure they were dead.",

"Then, a dog jumped from the somertin trenches and sprinted towards where the wounded lay. Azorel, his name, wore a white kerchief painted with the red cross on him and carried a box of morphin pills in his mouth. He ran around too fast for the kargits to care to waste bullets on him and found a soldier whose name we now know to be Lazăr Ciurea. This man took one pill and wrapped the dog's kerchief around his wounded ankle, then got up to try to walk back towards his lines",

"Immediately, three kargit machineguns no more than eight hundred meters from him were trained on his position, ready to end him once and for all. But an artillery shell, as if guided by God himself, cratered the ground at such an angle that a cloud of dust flew five meters high and three wide, and the kargit machineguns could no longer get an idea of where exactly he was until he descended the hill and was out of their sight.",
